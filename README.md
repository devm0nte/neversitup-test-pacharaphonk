# Test From Neversitup

## README.md show your lasted project or standard of init project structure and defined convention

## About the work
Most of the work was developed by NodeJS and ExpressJS Frameworks. There are several different languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript. By default the project structure will look something like like the following structure

## Project Structure

Examples of the structure is AQUATER Project from my recent project on Back-end Side

```plaintext
/project-root
|-- node_modules/
|-- sql/
|-- src/
|   |-- assets/
|   |-- config/
|   |-- controllers/
|   |-- locales/
|   |-- middleware/
|   |--   |--validators/
|   |-- models/
|   |--   |-- schema/
|   |-- routes/
|   |-- template/
|   |-- test/
|   |-- utils/
|   |--   |-- common/
|   |-- server.js
|-- docs/
|-- docker-compose.yml
|-- Dockerfile

```

Project structure in GoLang Project, 
```plaintext
/project-root
|-- front-office/ "use same structure"
|-- back-office/
|     |-- company-core-sourcecode/ "have same structure as src directory"
|     |-- bin/

|     |-- README.md
|-- docs/
```

## The Conventions

Classes and output Functions:- camelCase for most of code (upppercase starter)
Methods and Variables:- camelCase (lowercase starter)

Code Formatting :- use 4 spaces for indentation only

version control :- using gitlab in only three branches [main,dev,production]

## Documentation

I have a documentation of some project in this git hub account too
